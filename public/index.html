    <h2>Welcome, Traveller</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Rebel’s Tavern</strong> stands at the edge of a bustling crossroads — 
      a place where adventurers, knights, and common folk alike come to rest, share tales, and raise their mugs to fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Step inside, warm yourself by the fire, and join the other patrons.  
      The barkeep keeps track of every name and coin, and your deeds will shape your reputation across the land.
